# Automating systems that scale


I design cloud infrastructure and automate deployments. I work with AWS, Python, and Terraform to build systems that scale efficiently and run reliably.

Currently sharpening my skills through the AWS re/Start program, turning cloud concepts into production-ready solutions.

---

## How I Work

- I architect cloud solutions with AWS services—compute, storage, networking, and security
- I write Python scripts and Terraform configs to automate infrastructure
- I containerize applications with Docker and manage deployments through CI/CD pipelines
- I believe in infrastructure as code: if it's manual, it's not repeatable
